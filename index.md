## The problem
Start-ups and small companies do not have a well-adjusted organization scheme. 
People tend to struggle with defining what their activities and attributions should be,
as, in the beginning, a business is rather chaotic on a day to day basis.
A bad task-management system leads to inefficient practises that could translate
into financial loses.

## Our solution
`TaskYourself` is a web application for efficient project management. 
 * Users can **plan**, **follow** and **organize** their tasks within a project using 
a single application. 
 * Every team member an see the **bigger picture** and it 
becomes clear what they have to do.
 * The entire history of the activities is **accessible** at any time, and 
searching for past, current and future plans is **easy** and **immediate**.

## Customer segment
`TaskYourself` is suitable for:
 * small businesses 
 * start-up teams
 * anyone who wants a to manage their tasks on a day to day basis

## Competition 
 * `Trello`: easy to use, but forces ads on the free version
 * `Pintask`: good for team collaboration, but users must buy extensions
 * `Centrallo`: generous storage, but no time tracking

## Advantage over the competition
 * No ads or unnecessary graphical content
 * Intuitive and easy to use
 * No training needed
 * Time tracking and deadline notification
 * Task dependency
 * Better team organizing tools
 * Integration with Google Calendar
 * Platform independent, small footprint application

## Key metrics
 * `Users with an account`: in the launching phase, 
 the most important metric is the adoption rate of the platform. 
 * `Daily active users`: 
 * `Boards created daily`:
 * `Tasks created daily`: 

## Cost structure


## Revenue streams
The project aims to gain popularity by offering a 6-months trial period for companies.
After the expiration of the trial, companies will pay a monthly fee, depending on the number
of their employees. 
<br/>
Any individual outside of a company's boundaries will be able to use the application
free of charge, in order to drive adoption and in the hope that individuals who have
successfully organised their tasks with TaskYourself would consider upgrading to a 
company subscription as soon as they start their own business.
