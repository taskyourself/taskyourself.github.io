## The problem
Start-ups and small companies do not have a well-adjusted organization scheme. 
People tend to struggle with defining what their activities and attributions should be,
as, in the beginning, a business is rather chaotic on a day to day basis.
A bad task-management system leads to inefficient practises that could translate
into financial loses.

## Our solution
`TaskYourself` is a web application for efficient project management. 
 * Users can **plan**, **follow** and **organize** their tasks within a project using 
a single application. 
 * Every team member an see the **bigger picture** and it 
becomes clear what they have to do.
 * The entire history of the activities is **accessible** at any time, and 
searching for past, current and future plans is **easy** and **immediate**.

## Customer segment
`TaskYourself` is suitable for:
 * small businesses 
 * start-up teams
 * anyone who wants a to manage their tasks on a day to day basis

## Competition 
 * `Trello`: easy to use, but forces ads on the free version
 * `Pintask`: good for team collaboration, but users must buy extensions
 * `Centrallo`: generous storage, but no time tracking

## Advantage over the competition
 * No ads or unnecessary graphical content
 * Intuitive and easy to use
 * No training needed
 * Time tracking and deadline notification
 * Task dependency
 * Better team organizing tools
 * Integration with Google Calendar
 * Platform independent, small footprint application

## Key metrics
 * `Users with an account`: In the launching phase, 
 the most important metric is the adoption rate of the platform. We expect
 at least 25 individual accounts and 3 company accounts (includes accounts per employee)
 in the first 6 months. 
 * `Daily/weekly active users`: At least 25% of registered accounts are active once per day
 and at least 50% of registered accounts are active 2-3 times per week.
 * `Boards created`: We expect that every company will create at least 1 board per week and that
 every individual to create at least 1 board.
 * `Tasks created`: We expect that every company will create at least 1 task per employee per day
 and that every individual will create at leat 1 task per week (2-3 tasks per week for active users).

## Cost structure
Startup costs require careful planning and meticulous accounting. 
 * Salary of owner/manager
 * Employee expenses
 * Advertising and promotion - we will never succedd without promoting 
 * Softare Services
 * Unexpected expenses

## Revenue streams
The project aims to gain popularity by offering a **6-months trial period** for companies.
After the expiration of the trial, companies will pay a monthly fee, depending on the number
of their employees.<br/>
Any individual outside of a company's boundaries will be able to use the application
**free of charge**, in order to drive adoption and in the hope that individuals who have
successfully organised their tasks with TaskYourself would consider upgrading to a 
company subscription as soon as they start their own business.
