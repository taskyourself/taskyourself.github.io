## The problem
Start-ups and small companies do not have a well-adjusted organization scheme. 
People tend to struggle with defining what their activities and attributions should be,
as, in the beginning, a business is rather chaotic on a day to day basis.
A bad task-management system leads to inefficient practises that translate
directly into financial loses.

## Our solution
`TaskYourself` is a web application for efficient project management. 
 * Users can **plan**, **follow** and **organize** their tasks within a project using 
a single application. 
 * Every team member an see the **bigger picture** and it 
becomes clear what they have to do.
 * The entire history of the activities is **accessible** at any time, and 
searching for past, current and future plans is **easy** and **immediate**.

## Customer segment
`TaskYourself` is suitable for:
 * small businesses 
 * start-up teams
 * anyone who wants a to manage their tasks on a day to day basis

## Competition 
 * `Trello`: easy to use, but forces ads on the free version
 * `Pintask`: good for team collaboration, but users must buy extensions
 * `Centrallo`: generous storage, but no time tracking

## Advantage over the competition
 * No ads or unnecessary graphical content
 * Intuitive and easy to use
 * No training needed
 * Time tracking and deadline notification
 * Task dependency
 * Better team organizing tools
 * Integration with Google Calendar
 * Platform independent, small footprint application

## Key metrics
 * `Users with an account`: in the launching phase, 
 the most important metric is the adoption rate of the platform. 
 * `Daily active users`: 
 * `Boards created daily`:
 * `Tasks created daily`:
