      <h2 id="the-team">The problem</h2>
        <p>We were struggling with the problem ourselves. After multiple discussions with our collegues and friends, we became aware that most of us are frusted with organization tasks every day. People tend to switch between multiple apps for checking their schedule, their tasks and their deadlines.</p>


      <h2 id="the-problem">Our solution</h2>
      <p>We thought we need a web application for efficient task management, and so the idea for <code class="highlighter-rouge">TaskYourself</code> was borned. We wanted a platform where:</p>
      <ul>
  <li>Users can <strong>plan</strong>, <strong>follow</strong> and <strong>organize</strong> their tasks within a project using 
a single application.</li>
  <li>Every team member an see the <strong>bigger picture</strong> and it 
becomes clear what they have to do.</li>
  <li>The entire history of the activities is <strong>accessible</strong> at any time, and 
searching for past, current and future plans is <strong>easy</strong> and <strong>immediate</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="customer-segment">Plan for customer discovery</h2>
<p>We decided we would collect information using:</p>
<ul>
  <li>online forms</li>
  <li>face to face discussions</li>
  <li>our landing page for email collection for prospective users</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="competition">The process</h2>
<h3>How did we identify our customer segments?</h3>
According to our validation process, we discovered that a full 70% of people work in teams of below 12 members. Thus, we were guided towards small businesses and start-ups.

<h3>How did we reach them?</h3>
<p>We reached out to them face to face communication, social media and personal connection.</p>

<h3>How we collected information?</h3>
<p>We set up our <a href="https://taskyourself.github.io/">landing page</a> to collect emails from interested people. This did not yield great results so far.</p>
<p>We used an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSesExQ4vKmbXTM1HkDYj3eSq_z7ZIIdW7JG71LFvXh8AltdIw/viewform">online form</a> and shared it to our potential users. The questions we asked are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How old are you?</li>
  <li>Would you like to tell us your gender?</li>
  <li>Tell us about your work status.</li>
  <li>How many hours a week do you work?</li>
  <li>Do you work in a team?</li>
  <li>How big is the team you are a part of?</li>
  <li>How well do you organize your time?</li>
  <li>How much time do you invest in putting up your weekly schedule?</li>
  <li>How well do you stick to your schedule?</li>
  <li>Do you use any task management tool?</li>
  <li>What tool(s) do you use?</li>
  <li>What features do you like/use most?</li>
  <li>If you could have one more feature, what would it be?</li>
  <li>Would you like to start using a task management tool?</li>
  <li>What features would interest you most?</li>
</ul>


<h3>What did we learn from it?</h3>
<p>More than half of the people feel they don't organize well their time.</p>
<p>60% of people work in teams of <strong>3 - 12 people</strong></p>
<p><strong>52%</strong> of responders <strong>don't use</strong> any task management tool, but <strong>63% of them would like to</strong>. The features that most of them are interested in are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>boards</strong></li>
  <li><strong>deadline notification</strong></li>
  <li><strong>ability to colaborate with team members</strong></li>
  <li>easy to use interface</li>
  <li>lists</li>
</ul>
<p>The people who use task manangement tools <strong>use more than one platform</strong> and the two favourites are JIRA and Calendar. The most used features are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>boards</strong></li>
  <li><strong>ability to colaborate with team members</strong></li>
  <li><strong>lists</strong></li>
  <li>deadline notifications</li>
  <li>time tracking</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="advantage-over-the-competition">Results</h2>
These insights have reinforced our idea. People are interested in smart task management systems that provide a single platform for their needs. We now know what features are the most wanted and what we should focus on in the next steps.

<h2 id="key-metrics">Moving on..</h2>
We consider that we are ready to move on to the next step as people are interested in our product. As more than half of the people we interviewed don't use a task management system, <code class="highlighter-rouge">TaskYourself</code> can be easily marked and sold to them.
