      <h2 id="the-team">Interviews with potential users</h2>

      <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Interview structure</code></p>
      <p>We have organized our face-to-face interviews around the following questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Describe shortly a day at your workplace.</li>
        <li>How do you organize your daily tasks?</li>
        <li>What is the biggest problem that you confront yourself with everyday regarding organization?</li>
        <li>What task management systems have you used? Why did you use these products?</li>
        <li>What shortcomings did you encountered using these task management systems?</li>
        <li>If you could choose a new functionality for a new task management system to implement, what would that be?</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Interview with Loredana</h4>
      <p>Loredana is a business owner. She is 23 years old and started a bussiness for renting costumes for kids, with the help of her boyfriend and some friends.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>What would a usual day in your life look like?</li>
        <p>Oh, it's a mostly chaotic. I start my day by reviewing what I didn't get to do the previous day (it's always something!). New demands come all the time and I need
          to make sure the priorities are in order and that I do have the time to fulfill the existing demands.</p>
        <li>You mentioned the word 'chaos'. How did you try to improve this so far?</li>
        <p>Well, I try to keep track of everything using Excel documents. The review process I mentioned consists of choosing top 2 priorities for the day -
          in other words, what I have to achieve by the end of the day.</p>
        <li>Have you tried any task management systems?</li>
        <p>I mostly use G Suite tools for tracking my business. Especially Sheets, Docs and Calendar. They are pretty straightforward and for small workloads, they are fine.</p>
        <li>What did you not like about your experience with them?</li>
        <p>Well, team communication is not as straighforward as I would like. My team mates forget to check all the sheets and miss information. We called a few clients
          multiple times for the same order because someone failed to update everything in time. </p>
        <li>What other tools would you like to have?</li>
        <p>I'd like to check some user statistics to better manage my time. I need a better work-private life balance!</p>

      </ul>

      <h4>Interview with Cosmin</h4>
      <p>Cosmin is a software developer. He is 25 years old and works in collaborative environments for 2.5 years.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tell me how was today at your workplace.</li>
        <p>I began my day with a daily meeting with my team. We established our tasks for today and what problems we had yesterday. I then mostly worked on my assigned tasks.
          I also had some meetings after lunch for discussing new features we have to implement in the next release.</p>

        <li>How do you organize your daily tasks?</li>
        <p>I use Jira for project tasks and bug management, Trello for personal reasons and Google Calendar for checking my schedule.</p>

        <li>What issues do you have with these tools?</li>
        <p>I have no issues with them. I've use them for a long time. However, I still don't like Jira. </p>

        <li>Why?</li>
        <p>Well, there are too many customizations that need to be setup by an admin. Also, the history is split up in 4 tabs and the search withing a project could and should be a lot better</p>

        <li>What do you consider to be your greatest problem regarding daily task organization?</li>
        <p>Context switching. Jumping from one app to the other and also handling unexpected issues from clients or with my own code.</p>

        <li>Finally, what other thing you like to have from a task manangement tool?</li>
        <p>I'd like to have reminders build into JIRA or Trello. I have to admit I hated deadlines when I was in college, but now I think they'd make me more productive.</p>
      </ul>

      <h4>Interview with Mirela</h4>
      <p>Mirela works in sales for a small family business. She is 50 years old and has been working in her position for more than 10 years.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>What do you usually do at work?</li>
        <p>I add into the system bills from provider and I make payments for them according to our montly schedule. I also establish prices and discount for sales and make daily reports of our sales, stocks and so on.
        Most days, I also have other tasks given by management.</p>

        <li>How do you organize all these tasks?</li>
        <p>I usually have a routine, but when something unexpected appears, I change according to the priority (if it's an important client or if it's requested directly from my boss).</p>

        <li>Did you ever use task manangement systems?</li>
        <p>No, I don't think so. I usually have sticky notes on my desk wall with reminders.</p>

        <li>Would you consider using a software for this?</li>
        <p>Yes, I mostly use my computer for my other tasks too.</p>

        <li>What do you imagine this software should do?</li>
        <p>Well, I'd like to make some lists like my sticky notes. It would be nice if I could also add how much time it would take me to do certain things or when they are needed.</p>
      </ul>
