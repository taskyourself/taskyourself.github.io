      <p>We didn't know how to go about this milestone. We could not write a contract, as we are not legally entitled to sell any products. We decided that it was enough to get some people to use the product on a daily basis.</p>

      <h2>Alpha users</h2>
      <p>After constructing the MVP, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">TaskYourself team</code> became the first user. We added tasks for our daily life and our projected and checked how the application holds up.</p> 


      <p>We indeed found issues and things that we wanted to change. For instance, the colors of the columns on the board were blue, green and pink. Teodora pointed out that it would make a lot more sense if they represented the stage of the tasks, so we changed them to red, orange and green. Andra pointed out that she would like to have a customizable profile, as most applications allow at least a personalised display. So, we changed the upper corner menu to include a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Edit profile</code> button, where users can change their display name and their profile picture. It came naturally to add a section for customizing projects.</p>

      <p>After agreeing that the application was ready to see other users, we contacted people that left their email address on our <a href="index.html">Landing page</a>.</p>

     <h2 id="the-team">Users</h2>
     <p>At the moment, our MVP is used by 3 real teams and 7 users (even though <code class="highlighter-rouge">TaskYourself team</code> is a real team, we excluded it from the counts). The following screenshot presents the users that gave us the permission to display their personal information:</p>

Before TaskYourself, we managed every aspect of our business through social media messaging apps. So, if I would ask him if he prepared that package and delivered that other one and then what he'd like for dinner. The separation is very clear now, it helped our communication a lot. Also, the Christmas period was very busy and it become harder to keep track of the orders. TaskYourself came to the rescue again! It became a habit to add everything there for future reference."</p>

However, the interface gets a bit cluttered after adding all the tasks I need. A delete or archive button for the tasks and even for the project would be appreciated. I liked that the team kept in contact after I submitted feedback, they were always helpful and honest."</p>

        <p><i class='fas fa-comment-dots' style='font-size:22px'></i> "As an employee in a small business, my schedule often ends up in being chaotic and just using an agenda, sticky notes and a calendar application is not enough to help me accomplish all my tasks and thoroughly organise them. Using TaskYourself is a very good alternative, since it offers anything I need wrapped in a easy-to-use interface. I use the application to create various tasks (for example - update the stock prices, introduce bills to accountability), I can add descriptions or I can share them among my colleagues. TaskYourself is a tool that helps our team to collaborate easier, since every one of us is now aware of the progress on tasks, hence we can re-prioritise the work or split it efficiently between us. Overall, I am very excited about this product and eager to see and use the new features, especially the deadline notification one."</p>
