      <h2 id="the-team">Lead collection section to our landing page</h2>
<p>We have added at the begginning of the landing page a form for collecting email:</p>
<img src ="img/screenshots/s1.png"/>
<img src ="img/screenshots/s2.png"/>
<p>At the moment, we have collected <code class="highlighter-rouge">37</code> email addresses.</p>


<h2 id="the-problem">Analytics on our landing page</h2>
<p>We have added <code class="highlighter-rouge">HotJar</code> script to our landing page (in order to generate a website heatmap, receive incoming feedback and see how many people that visit our site actually subscribe to our page):</p>
<img src ="img/screenshots/s3.png"/>
<img src ="img/screenshots/s4.png"/>
<p>We have also enabled <code class="highlighter-rouge">Google Analytics</code> as one can see in the picture below:</p>
<img class="mx-auto d-block" src ="img/screenshots/s7.png"/>

<h2 id="the-problem">Conversion Rate</h2>
<p>Our goal is to collect as many email addresses as possible.</p>
<p>Out of 95 people that viewed our page, 38 left their email address in order to receive notifications.</p>
<p>The conversion rate is pretty high: <code class="highlighter-rouge">40%.</code></p>


<h2 id="our-solution">Bringing people in...</h2>
<p> We have created a Facebook page called <code class="highlighter-rouge">TaskYourself</code> for our product. You can find the page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/taskyourself/">here</a></p>
<p>We have started posting about the product:</p> 
<img src ="img/screenshots/s5.png" class="mx-auto d-block"/>
<img src ="img/screenshots/s6.png" class="mx-auto d-block"/>
<p>Please like, share, subscribe <a href ="https://www.facebook.com/251661595501045/posts/251689018831636/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/251661595501045/posts/251699648830573/">here</a>!</p>
<p>We have also shared the page in multiple private chats with our friends and co-workers, but we cannot share these conversations due to privacy reasons. This method seemed to work best.</p>
